### 2) Mall Customers Dataset – KMeans Clustering

* **Tool Used:** Power BI with Embedded Python Scripts
* **Description:**
  Implementation of **KMeans Clustering** on the **Mall Customers dataset** to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.
* **Features:**

  * **Python Script Integration in Power BI** for running KMeans.
  * Customer segmentation into distinct clusters.
  * Scatter plots with highlighted centroids for clear visualization.
  * Helps businesses target the right customer groups effectively.

# 📊 Data Mining and Warehousing (DMW) – Practical Implementation

This repository contains practical implementations of **Data Mining and Warehousing concepts** using real-world datasets and visualization tools such as **Power BI** and **Python**.

## 🔹 Contents

### 1) Sneaker Dataset Dashboard

* **Tool Used:** Power BI
* **Description:**
  A fully interactive **dashboard** was created on the **Sneaker dataset** to analyze sales, trends, and insights.
* **Features:**

  * Visual representation of sneaker sales & demand.
  * Filters for brand, price range, and time period.
  * KPIs for tracking performance.

### 2) Mall Customers Dataset – KMeans Clustering

* **Tool Used:** Power BI with Embedded Python Scripts
* **Description:**
  Implementation of **KMeans Clustering** on the **Mall Customers dataset** to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.
* **Features:**

  * **Python Script Integration in Power BI** for running KMeans.
  * Customer segmentation into distinct clusters.
  * Scatter plots with highlighted centroids for clear visualization.
  * Helps businesses target the right customer groups effectively.

### 3) Hospital Dataset – Star Schema & Snowflake Schema

* **Tool Used:** Power BI

* **Description:**
  Designed **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** using a **Hospital dataset** to understand schema modeling in **Data Warehousing**.

* **Star Schema:**

  * **Fact Table:** Appointments
  * **Dimension Tables:** Patients, Doctors, Departments, Treatments, Billing
  * Direct relationships between fact and dimensions.

* **Snowflake Schema:**

  * Normalized dimension tables:

    * Treatments → linked with extended table containing treatment names
    * Doctors → linked with extended tables containing doctor level of qualification
  * Reduces redundancy and improves organization.

* **Features:**

  * Learned how to build relationships and set cardinality in Power BI.
  * Compared **Star Schema (denormalized, faster queries)** vs **Snowflake Schema (normalized, organized)**.
  * Gained hands-on understanding of **Data Warehouse modeling**.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used

* **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & visualization.
* **Python** – Data preprocessing & clustering.
* **Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn** – For clustering logic.
* **Data Warehousing Concepts** – Star Schema, Snowflake Schema.

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

* Hands-on experience in **Data Visualization** with Power BI.
* Practical application of **KMeans clustering** for customer segmentation.
* Designed and implemented **Star Schema & Snowflake Schema** for a hospital dataset.
* Understood trade-offs between **denormalized vs normalized** schema design.
* Integration of **Python with Power BI** for advanced analytics.

---

## 📌 Future Scope

* Extending sneaker dataset analysis with predictive modeling.
* Applying other clustering methods (Hierarchical, DBSCAN).
* Implementing **OLAP operations** (Roll-up, Drill-down, Slice, Dice) on Hospital Dataset.
* Building recommendation systems based on patient–doctor specialization mapping.
